        <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
        <p>
          You can drag and drop music into the program to be added automatically to the current music folder.<br>
          If you drag and drop a <b>jpg</b> file onto a currently playing song,<br>
          it will set it as background for the song. (It will first update when you go off the song and back on it)
        </p>
        <h2>Functions & Shortcuts</h2>
        <p>
          Pressing on <b>Alt+R</b> will set it to shuffle through songs instead of linearly.<br>
          Pressing <b>Alt+S</b> will open the settings menu. There's currently 2 settings only: Background Dim, and Toggle Visualizer.<br>
          It still doesn't have a volume changer BUT i will get it done, just not done it yet >_> The default volume is 30% so it isn't ear killing from the get-go
        </p>
        <h2>Build-in YouTube Downloader</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, you can insert a link and a title for the song (Formatted as [Artist - Title])<br>
          It will download from the link into an mp3 file and put it in your music folder.<br>
          Make sure the link is valid, and don't forget to give it a name, I have no clue what happens if you don't... so don't test it
        </p>
